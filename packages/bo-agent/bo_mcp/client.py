class BoMcpClient:
    """REST client for the BO-MCP campaign API.

    Campaign lifecycle, in call order:

    1. ``validate_intake(intake)`` — dry-run the campaign intake payload; a
       rejected intake raises ``BoMcpOperationError`` with ``field_errors``
       in the payload.
    2. ``create_campaign(intake, idempotency_key=...)`` — returns ``campaign_id``.
    3. Optimization loop:
       a. ``next_action(campaign_id)`` — ask the server whether another
          round is warranted; act on its ``action`` field instead of any
          client-side progress bookkeeping.
       b. ``generate_suggestions(campaign_id, batch_size=...)`` — ask the BO
          backend for new candidate suggestions, or
          ``query_suggestions(campaign_id, status_filter="pending")`` to reuse
          suggestions that already exist.
       c. Evaluate the suggested candidates externally.
       d. ``submit_results(campaign_id, results=..., idempotency_key=...)`` —
          report finite objective values as measurements.
       e. ``update_suggestion_status(suggestion_id, status)`` — mark
          suggestions e.g. ``"rejected"`` when they are duplicates or out of
          the active space.
       f. ``get_diagnostics(campaign_id)`` — expensive: server recomputes
          from all results, so it slows down as the campaign grows. Call
          once at the end of an invocation, not per iteration, and give
          that call a very forgiving timeout (minutes on a grown campaign
          are expected — the default ``timeout_s`` will not suffice).
    4. ``export_campaign(campaign_id, fmt=...)`` — raw artifact download
       (CSV/blob, returned as bytes; never JSON-parsed).
    5. ``lifecycle(campaign_id, action=...)`` — pause/resume/terminate, and
       reopen to return a completed campaign to running for continuation.
       At the end of an invocation pause the campaign rather than
       terminating it; a paused campaign continues with ``action="resume"``,
       a completed one with ``action="reopen"``. Never rebuild an existing
       campaign by replaying its results as seeds — resume or reopen it.

    Loop-state ownership: the BO-MCP server is the single source of truth
    for campaign progress (results, iteration, status, and the next-action
    recommendation). Campaign scripts must not persist loop state to disk —
    no ``campaign_state.json``, no exhaustion flags, no local iteration
    counters. Artifact files (results JSONL, diagnostics history, reports)
    are append-only provenance for analysis and figures: write them freely,
    but the loop must never read them back to decide what to do next. CLI
    budgets such as ``--max-successes`` bound one process invocation, never
    the campaign; do not encode them as ``max_iterations`` in the campaign
    intake — the intake is immutable, and a fossilized cap makes a reopened
    campaign refuse suggestions forever. Leave ``max_iterations`` unset
    unless the user names a whole-campaign budget. The canonical loop
    skeleton::

        while invocation_budget_remaining():
            decision = client.next_action(campaign_id)
            if decision["action"] != "bo_generate_suggestions":
                break
            suggestion = client.generate_suggestions(campaign_id, batch_size=1)
            # ... evaluate candidates externally ...
            client.submit_results(campaign_id, results=..., idempotency_key=...)

    Written this way, a killed or paused run resumes by re-running the same
    entrypoint with ``--campaign-id``: the loop re-derives its position from
    the server and continues.

    Schema authority: this client fixes only the transport — paths, methods,
    headers, and the error contract. All request and response payload shapes
    (campaign intake, result rows, suggestion records, diagnostics) are
    defined by the BO-MCP API and passed through as plain dicts. For the
    exact field shapes of any payload, inspect the corresponding operation
    in the live OpenAPI spec via ``inspect_bo_mcp_openapi_operation``.

    Error contract: non-2xx responses raise ``BoMcpClientError``, as do
    non-JSON bodies on the JSON helpers (``export_campaign`` is exempt — it
    returns raw bytes by design); a 2xx JSON object carrying ``success: false`` raises
    ``BoMcpOperationError`` (BO-MCP semantics: request processed, operation
    rejected — checking only the status code would hide the rejection).
